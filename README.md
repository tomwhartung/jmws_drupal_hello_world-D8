# jmws_drupal_hello_world-d8

Before integrating idMyGadget with drupal 8 it would be a good idea to know about "D8."

I was thinking I could experiment with the module (and there is some hello world code in it at this time) but now I am thinking that there have been so many changes, it would be best to do this by itself, in a separate repo.
