# jmws_drupal_hello_world-d8

Before integrating idMyGadget with drupal 8 it would be a good idea to know about "D8."

Just so much has changed and reading web pages and watching videos can only go so far.

So I am downloading these and checking them in to my own repo for extensive experimentation and hopefully of course massive learning:
* the [Hello World example from drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/node/2464195)
* the hugs example from the [Drupal 8 Crash Course video, from DrupalCon LA 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vwC_01KFLo) - renamed to my_hugs

I was thinking I could learn what I need to know by reading (it has worked in the past!) or even gently experimenting with these modules a bit, but now it's apparent that that there have been so many changes, it would be best to copy the code into a separate repo so I can save off my experiments, both failures and successes, but especially the successes.

Thanks and wish me luck.
