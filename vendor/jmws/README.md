# jmws_drupal_hello_world-d8

Trying out putting code in the vendor directory.

This is probably where it belongs anyway.

I am finding out it is easier to try things with trivial classes before trying to integrate my code with the new D8.

At this point, this is all rather experimental for me.

For more information see the README.md file in the root directory.
